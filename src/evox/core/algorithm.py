        Override this method if you need to initialize the population in a special way.
        For example, Genetic Algorithm needs to evaluate the fitness of the initial population of size N,
        but after that, it only need to evaluate the fitness of the offspring of size M, and N != M.
        Since JAX requires the function return to have static shape, we need to have two different functions,
        one is the normal `ask` and another is `init_ask`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state
            The state of this algorithm.

        Returns
        -------
        population
            The candidate solution.
        state
            The new state of the algorithm.
