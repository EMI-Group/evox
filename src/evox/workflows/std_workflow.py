        algorithm
            The algorithm.
        problem
            The problem.
        monitor
            Optional monitor(s).
            Configure a single monitor or a list of monitors.
            The monitors will be called in the order of the list.
        opt_direction
            The optimization direction, can be either "min" or "max"
            or a list of "min"/"max" to specific the direction for each objective.
        candidate_transforms
            Optional candidate solution transform function,
            usually used to decode the candidate solution
            into the format that can be understood by the problem.
            Should be a list of functions,
            and the functions will be applied in the order of the list.
        fitness_transforms
            Optional fitness transform function.
            usually used to apply fitness shaping.

            Tell workflow whether the problem is external that cannot be jitted.
            Default to False.
        num_objectives
            Number of objectives. Used when external_problem=True.
            When the problem cannot be jitted, JAX cannot infer the shape, and
