    Calculate the Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) metric between a set of solutions and the Pareto front.

    The IGD metric is used to evaluate the quality of an approximation to the Pareto front by computing the average
    distance between each point in the approximation and the nearest point on the true Pareto front.

    :param objs: A tensor of shape (n, m), where n is the number of solutions and m is the number of objectives.
                 Represents the set of solutions to be evaluated.
    :param pf: A tensor of shape (k, m), where k is the number of points on the Pareto front and m is the number
               of objectives. Represents the true Pareto front.
    :param p: The power parameter used in the calculation (default is 1). This defines the distance metric (L^p norm).

    :return: The IGD score, a scalar representing the average distance of the solutions to the Pareto front.

    :note:
        The IGD score is lower when the approximation is closer to the Pareto front.
