    Calculate the Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) metric between a set of solutions and the Pareto front.

    :param pf: A tensor of shape (k, m), where k is the number of points on the Pareto front and m is the number

    :note:
        The IGD score is lower when the approximation is closer to the Pareto front.
