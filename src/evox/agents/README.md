This module contains the core logic for the `Agent` of the Evolutionary Multiagent system.
It defines the `Agent` class, which represents an individual agent in the system, along with its properties and behaviors.
In a Evolutionary Multiagent system, agents runs in a lockstep manner, meaning that all agents perform their actions simultaneously in discrete time steps. The agents can either be LLM-backed AI agents or just simple rule-based agents, for example, particles in PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) can be considered as agents as well.
