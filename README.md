EvoX is a distributed GPU-accelerated framework for scalable evolutionary computation. Our primary goal is to push the boundaries of evolutionary computation by significantly enhancing its speed and versatility, enabling its application to complex and computationally intensive tasks.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Features
- üöÄ Fast
  - GPU computing for 10x-100x faster optimization.
  - Distributed workflow for even faster optimization.
- üåü Wide support
  - Single-objective and multi-objective optimization.
  - Comprehensive support for commonly used benchmark problems.
  - Extensive coverage of neuroevolution problems.
- üéâ Easy to use
  - Functional programming for easy function composition.
  - Hierarchical state management for modular programming.
  - Detailed tutorial available [here](https://evox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/index.html).

EvoX offers a powerful and user-friendly optimization framework, empowering researchers and practitioners to easily tackle a variety of optimization tasks. The support for commonly used benchmark problems, along with the coverage of neuroevolution problems, provides a versatile platform for optimization experimentation. With its fast GPU computing and distributed workflow capabilities, EvoX enables efficient optimization of complex and computationally intensive problems. The functional programming and hierarchical state management further enhance the ease of use and modularity of the framework.

For more detailed list, please refer to our API documentation. [List of Algorithms](https://evox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/algorithms/index.html) and [List of Problems](https://evox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/problems/index.html).


## Installation

We recommand install `evox` using `pip`

```bash
pip install evox
```

EvoX depends on JAX. To install JAX, please refer to JAX's installation guide [here](https://github.com/google/jax?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

## Quick Start

To start with, import `evox`

```python
import evox
from evox import algorithms, problems, workflows
```

Then, create an algorithm and a problem:

```python
pso = algorithms.PSO(
    lb=jnp.full(shape=(2,), fill_value=-32),
    ub=jnp.full(shape=(2,), fill_value=32),
    pop_size=100,
)
ackley = problems.numerical.Ackley()
```

To run the EC workflow, compose the algorithm and the problem together using `workflow`:

```python
workflow = workflows.StdWorkflow(pso, ackley)
```

To initialize the whole workflow, call `init` on the workflow object with a PRNGKey. Calling `init` will recursively initialize a tree of objects, meaning the algorithm pso and problem ackley are automatically initialize as well.

```python
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
state = workflow.init(key)
```

Now, call `step` to execute one iteration of the workflow.

```python
# run the workflow for 100 steps
for i in range(100):
    state = workflow.step(state)
```

## Example

The [example](https://github.com/EMI-Group/evox/tree/main/examples) folder has many examples on how to use EvoX.
